GPU/OpenCL support for Windows
------------------------------
OpenCL can be used by default on Windows.

Please download the CLBlast library and set the execution path.

- [CLBlast library](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast/releases)

```shell
C:TEMP>PATH %PATH%;C:\CLBlast\CLBlast-1.6.2-Windows-x64\bin
```

Configure the rindow-neuralnetworks backend to use OpenCL.

+ Verify that rindow-math-matrix is Accelerated and the OpenCL driver is recognized.
+ Set environment variables to use GPU in rindow-neuralnetworks backend.
+ Run the sample program.

```shell
C:tutorials>vendor\bin\rindow-math-matrix
Service Level   : Accelerated
Buffer Factory  : Rindow\Math\Buffer\FFI\BufferFactory
BLAS Driver     : Rindow\OpenBLAS\FFI\Blas
LAPACK Driver   : Rindow\OpenBLAS\FFI\Lapack
Math Driver     : Rindow\Matlib\FFI\Matlib
OpenCL Factory  : Rindow\OpenCL\FFI\OpenCLFactory
CLBlast Factory : Rindow\CLBlast\FFI\CLBlastFactory

C:tutorials>SET RINDOW_NEURALNETWORKS_BACKEND=rindowclblast::GPU
C:tutorials>cd samples
C:samples>php basic-image-clasification.php
```
Note: RINDOW_NEURALNETWORKS_BACKEND can specify an OpenCL device type or a set of platform ID and device ID in addition to a name such as rindowclblast. If you have two or more GPUs, you can use this specification method to identify them. for example;

- rindowclblast       => platform #0, device #0
- rindowclblast::GPU  => GPU type device: Integrated GPU, etc.
- rindowclblast::CPU  => CPU type device: pocl-opencl-icd, etc.
- rindowclblast::0,0  => platform #0, device #0
- rindowclblast::0,1  => platform #0, device #1
- rindowclblast::1,0  => platform #1, device #0

If you are unable to successfully set the target GPU, please check the OpenCL device status using the clinfo command.

```shell
C:tutorials>vendor\bin\clinfo
Number of platforms(1)
Platform(0)
    CL_PLATFORM_NAME=Intel(R) OpenCL
    CL_PLATFORM_PROFILE=FULL_PROFILE
....
...
..
```


GPU/OpenCL support for Ubuntu
------------------------------
It is essential that OpenCL works properly in the Linux environment.
(That's quite difficult)

Install the OpenCL environment.

```shell
$ sudo apt install clinfo
$ sudo apt install intel-opencl-icd
```
Ubuntu standard OpenCL drivers include:
- mesa-opencl-icd
- beignet-opencl-icd
- intel-opencl-icd
- nvidia-opencl-icd-xxx
- pocl-opencl-icd

The standard Linux OpenCL driver does not work properly, so we deal with it on a case-by-case basis to make it work somehow for each driver and version.

Check that OpenCL is running using the clinfo command.

```shell
$ clinfo
Number of platforms                               1
  Platform Name                                   Intel Gen OCL Driver
  Platform Vendor                                 Intel
....
...
..
```

Download and install the CLBlast library.
Scripts are available for easy download and installation.

+ Check the latest version: [CLBlast library](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast/releases)
+ Copy script
+ Change the version at the beginning of the script
+ Run script and create deb file
+ Install deb file

```shell
$ cp vendor/rindow/rindow-clblast-ffi/clblast-packdeb.sh .
$ vi clblast-packdeb.sh
CLBLASTVERSION=1.6.2   <===== change
$ sh clblast-packdeb.sh
$ sudo apt install ./clblast_X.X.X-1+ubuntuXX.XX_amd64.deb
```

Configure the rindow-neuralnetworks backend to use OpenCL.

+ Verify that rindow-math-matrix is Accelerated and the OpenCL driver is recognized.
+ Set environment variables to use GPU in rindow-neuralnetworks backend.
+ Run the sample program.

```shell
$ vendor\bin\rindow-math-matrix
Service Level   : Accelerated
Buffer Factory  : Rindow\Math\Buffer\FFI\BufferFactory
BLAS Driver     : Rindow\OpenBLAS\FFI\Blas
LAPACK Driver   : Rindow\OpenBLAS\FFI\Lapack
Math Driver     : Rindow\Matlib\FFI\Matlib
OpenCL Factory  : Rindow\OpenCL\FFI\OpenCLFactory
CLBlast Factory : Rindow\CLBlast\FFI\CLBlastFactory

$ RINDOW_NEURALNETWORKS_BACKEND=rindowclblast::GPU
$ export RINDOW_NEURALNETWORKS_BACKEND
$ cd samples
$ php basic-image-clasification.php
```
Note: RINDOW_NEURALNETWORKS_BACKEND can specify an OpenCL device type or a set of platform ID and device ID in addition to a name such as rindowclblast. If you have two or more GPUs, you can use this specification method to identify them. for example;

- rindowclblast       => platform #0, device #0
- rindowclblast::GPU  => GPU type device: Integrated GPU, etc.
- rindowclblast::CPU  => CPU type device: pocl-opencl-icd, etc.
- rindowclblast::0,0  => platform #0, device #0
- rindowclblast::0,1  => platform #0, device #1
- rindowclblast::1,0  => platform #1, device #0

If you are unable to successfully set the target GPU, please check the OpenCL device status using the clinfo command.
